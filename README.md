# BitBoard Checkers
### Checkers Using Bitwise Operations

This project was made using Visual Studio 22

Target: .NET 8.0

Project Information:

I was given the task of using individual bits for representing pieces on a checkers board and manipulating their state using bitwise operations. Traditionally when approaching a project such as this, I would use an object oriented approach (OOP) and represent each piece on the board as a struct that contains various properties such as, color, king status, etc. , but that was not acceptable for this project. These constraints forced me to approach the problem in a way that was novel for me, and in the process, gave me a better understanding of the possibilities for representing data using a minimal memory footprint. Please see the included paper for more information about my process (linked below).
